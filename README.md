# Here 4 Reentry

Here 4 Reentry is a community based organization focused around creating a toolset for previously incarcerated "returning citizens" to connect socially with one another, learn important information about quality social services, and organize politically to advocate for issues relevant to their lives and their communities. These are our neighbors, our friends and our family.

Here 4 Reentry's mission is to provide returning citizens everywhere with an all-in-one resource portal and to support an ecosystem of information sharing and connection to care.

This weekend we are working on a tool that will help social services communicate with each other and share information, all so that everyday people can get correct and up to date information when they need it most!

Our goal is to make progress toward creating a crawler that will interact with social service information available online. We will be aggregating and evaluating this data for accuracy and relevancy in hopes of making it easier to different social service organization to maintain accurate information. Ultimately this data will power a version of the [Ohana API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api), a Ruby on Rails application that makes it easy for communities to publish and maintain a database of social services.
