# Here 4 Reentry

Here 4 Reentry is a community based organization focused on creating a toolset for previously incarcerated "returning citizens" successfully reintegrate into society. We use online tools to help returning citizens interact socially with one another, learn about important social services available to them, and organize politically to advocate for issues relevant to their lives and their communities. These are our neighbors, our friends and our family.

Here 4 Reentry's mission is to provide returning citizens everywhere with an all-in-one resource portal and to support an ecosystem of information sharing and connection to care.

Existing social service aggregators run on siloed data. This data easily becomes outdated and it is very costly to keep it updated at each different location. This weekend we are working on a tool that will help these social services use a shared aggregated data set that can be centrally maintained. This will reduce costs and improve accuracy, which will improve users get the information they need in an accurate and timely manner.

Our goal is to create a crawler that will pull information from publicly available social service websites, aggregate the data, evaluating this data for accuracy and relevancy, and generate standardized data dumps in hopes of making it easier for the social service organization to maintain accurate information. Ultimately this data will power a version of the [Ohana API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api), a Ruby on Rails application that makes it easy for communities to publish and maintain a database of social services.
